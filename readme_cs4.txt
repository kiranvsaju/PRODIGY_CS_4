This Python program uses the pynput library to create a keylogger that records keystrokes and saves them to a file named keylogs.txt. The program defines functions to handle key press and release events. The write_to_file function writes the recorded keys to the log file, converting special keys like space, enter, and tab into their respective characters. The on_press function appends each pressed key to a list and writes to the file when the list reaches ten keys. The on_release function stops the keylogger when the escape key is pressed. The program uses a keyboard listener to monitor and record keystrokes, making it useful for understanding how to capture and process keyboard input in Python. This tool can be run in any Python 3.x environment with the pynput library installed.
